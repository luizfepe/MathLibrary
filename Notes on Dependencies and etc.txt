Errors in Unity:
**"EntryPointNotFound"
means the CPP dll functions are not properly declared in the C# interface.
I give you, reader, an example as soon as I rollback the mess in GIT and get the DLL interface code.
It may happen, it may not.


**"DllNotFound"
means the adjacent dependencies were not found.
Solved by copying other libraries (k4a.h, k4abt.dll, etc) to the folder:
Program Files/Unity/Hub/"UnityVersion"/Editor/
 

**Marshal problems:
Marshal is a converter from "pointer" output from the dll to other types.
However, Marshal doesn't like arrays or custom/unmanaged types.

Put this before struct declarations in C#

[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)]
[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst = 5)]

Use this to get the pointer from the Cpp DLL and decode into strucs, including arrays:

MyStruct_t pMyStruct = (MyStruct_t)Marshal.PtrToStructure(pMyStructPTR, typeof(MyStruct_t));



**Kinect turns LED on but then turns off
DLL/Libs problem. It happened to have duplicates around the "path'ed" folders.
For example: DNN_onnx or something or cuda64.dll or something was present in the Assets/Plugins folder, but also in 
Program Files/Unity/Hub/"UnityVersion"/Editor/
